<h1> Hey! I'm TwoOneTwo </h1>

<h1> About me </h1> 
<p> Currently, I am interested in becoming a Front-End-Developer. 
  As of 2022-6-27, I am 14 years old, even though I'm stil young I do practice coding a lot and the programming languages I'm interested in are HTML, CSS. Hopefully in the future I will start learning JavaScript and learn React so I can start building more beautiful things as well as improve my understanding of these programming languages.
  Currently, the way I am practicing is by using websites such as FrontEndMentor, this site is very helpful as it provides problems as well as a certain amount of code to give you a start and understanding about it so you can perfect it as well as have other people to review it. Currently as of 2022-6-27, I've completed 3 of their projects but I have only started to use their site since 2022-6-25. These projects that I've completed helped my understanding of CSS and HTML but also taught me how to perfect the site using the reflection of other people as well as my own thoughts!
