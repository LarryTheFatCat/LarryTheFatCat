<h1>Why these languages?</h1>

<p>
I chose these languages to learn because I was in my peak of learning languages as well as because I had a dream of becoming a Front-End-Web Developer.
HTML and CSS were the quickest to learn, I don't learn Java anymore due to it being complicated.
Currently JavaScript is what I'm learning!

<h1>Major Projects I have finished</h1>

</li>
</ul>

<h1>Plans for the Future</h1>
Hopefully in the near future I will fully finish learning JS and get into React or maybe NEXT.JS as they both are major frameworks you should learn to get into Web Development.
