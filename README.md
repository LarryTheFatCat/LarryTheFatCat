<p> Currently, I am interested in becoming a Front-End-Developer. 
  As of 2022-6-27, I am 14 years old, even though I'm stil young I do practice coding and markup languages such as HTML, some of the programming markup languages and Markup languages I'm interested in are HTML, CSS. Hopefully in the future I will start learning JavaScript and learn React so I can start building more beautiful websites as well as improve my understanding of these programming languages.
  Currently, the way I am practicing is by using websites such as FrontEndMentor, this site is very helpful as it provides problems as well as a certain amount of code to give you a start and understanding about it so you can perfect it as well as have other people to review it. Currently as of 2022-6-27, I've completed 3 of their projects but I have only started to use their site since 2022-6-25. These projects that I've completed helped my understanding of CSS and HTML but also taught me how to perfect the site using the reflection of other people as well as my own thoughts.

<h1> My Background with Coding! <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white"> </h1>
<p> As of 2022-6-27, I've learned a total of 2 Coding Languages and 1 markup language, these languages include: CSS, HTML as well as Java. Since we've talked about my background with CSS and HTML, I think we should go into depth about Java. When New Years '22 started, I vowed to become a Front-End-Developer for a company to make my dad proud. When I thought about that I realized that one of the most popular languages was Java! When I started learning Java it was a very hard process because it was very confusing as well as hard to remember some of the methods, when I was told to create a Password Generator to help my understanding of Java, this process was a little hard as I did not know that much of Java but at the time I knew how to create one but the total look of it was very simple but after I showed it I was told to make it run out of IDE, this was the hardest part creating the password generator because I did not know how to create one out of IDE, it was until I discovered Java Swing. The way Swing acted was like using Tinker. The only downside of using Swing was the limitations of it. Due to it not being developed anymore, I had to rely on old guides and forums for they were the only ones that had actual information abaout it. Once I made it ran out of IDE mode, I decided to go into depth about it, making it as big as possible to support my every need for it. It was until I did it that I realized that how unstable it was, I ended up having to stop working on it because anything I did would conflict with some of the code which made me be forced to stop.
